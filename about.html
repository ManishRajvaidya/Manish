         <h2>About Navya School</h2>
         <p class="anu">The MLC School Society (Mylapore Ladiesâ€™ Club) 
             established a Kindergarten Section on 3rd February, 
             1956 to accommodate the boys in Mylapore and its 
             environs.
<br><br>
            The first president of the society was Sister
             Subbalakshmi, supported by Shri Subbaraya Aiyar, 
             a  leading   lawyer   of   his   time,  and Mrs.
              Padmini Chari, Educationist. Thus the school was
               born through the efforts of the three, and Vidya
                Mandir Matriculation School was formally opened
                 in 1960.
            <br><br>
            The MLC School Society was registered in 1957, and
             the properties of the club were transferred to it.
              Sister R. S. Subbalakshmi and Mrs V K T Chari, 
              were Founder President and Correspondent 
              respectively, Shri. M Subbaraya Aiyar became 
              the Secretary of the school.</p>

               <h2 style="color: chartreuse;">OUR PHILOSOPHY</h2> 
                
                <p style="text-align: center; color: darkorange;">... that children blossom in an environment free of unhealthy fear<br>
                ... that each child will blossom but at different times; so we have to give each one the time<br>
                ... that reward rather than punishment facilitates learning<br>
                ... that teaching is never complete till learning is complete<br>
                ... that we need to teach the way students can learn<br>
                ... the world is beautiful because of the variety<br>
             </p> </p>
